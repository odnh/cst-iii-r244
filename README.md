# Using Graph Nets for graph algorithm execution

This code is for the Cambridge Computer Science Part III course R244: Large Scale Data Processing and Optimisation.

## Diretory layout:
- `graph_nets`: cli python script to execute SSSP, CC and PR given a graph in edgelist format
- `graphchi`: implementation of SSSP for GraphChi (CC and PR can be found as examples in the official project repository on GitHub)
- `testing`: contains the scriopts used to generate the three graph types and run the tests for the different systems and algorithms over said graph types
